# ldapscripts
scripts and files to help set up an ldap server

See my
[LDAP for small CS Department](https://jeffknerr.github.io/ldap/linux/debian/ubuntu/2021/04/28/ldap-for-small-department.html) post for more info on using these scripts and ldif files.

To all "college" references to a "real-name" for your school
(e.g., convert cs.college.edu to cs.realname.edu) run the 
`convert.sh` script:

```
./convert.sh realname
```
